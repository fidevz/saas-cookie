## Key Features

### Multi-tenancy
Subdomain-based. Each tenant gets their own `slug.yourdomain.com`. The `TenantMiddleware` resolves the tenant on every request. Works on `slug.localhost` in development.

### Auth
JWT access token (5 min, in-memory) + refresh token (7 days, HttpOnly cookie). Google OAuth via django-allauth. Silent token refresh on expiry.

### Billing
Full Stripe integration: plans, checkout, customer portal, webhook handling, trial periods. Subscription state driven entirely by Stripe webhooks.

### Feature Flags
Three built-in flags (`FEATURE_TEAMS`, `FEATURE_BILLING`, `FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS`) controlled via env vars. Synced to the frontend automatically. Add your own in `config/settings/base.py`.

### Autonomous Marketing
The `marketing/` folder contains a complete AI-operated marketing system. Fill in `marketing/context/PRODUCT.md`, set budgets in `marketing/strategy/BUDGET.md`, configure your API keys, and Claude runs campaigns on a cron schedule.

## Customizing for Your Project

4. Set real numbers in `marketing/strategy/BUDGET.md` and `marketing/decisions/THRESHOLDS.md`
5. Replace placeholder content in `legal/` documents and publish them
6. Complete `ops/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` before going live
7. Read `CLAUDE.md` for full developer context
